For the question 5 test I began by trying to figure out how the code for spell effects works
and finding what files were needed to make a spell function. Documentation on spells was not easy to 
find, but I was able to find a tutorial on the OTLand forums that explained the basic parts of 
the code for a spell. Looking at the question video I decided to try and get the diamond shape
down first, and then figure out how to animate it later. This was honestly the most difficult part,
the creation of the combatArea took lots of trial and error with changing the size and shape of the
array to try and get the correct diamond shape. After this I took a break and worked on question 7
which is where I learned about the addEvent() function. I knew that I would need to create some kind of
loop and loop through an array of areas to create the animated effect, but I was not sure what kind of
wait or pause equivalent tfs and otc had. With addEvent I could loop through the list of areas one at a
time with a pause inbetween creating a keyframed animation effect.
